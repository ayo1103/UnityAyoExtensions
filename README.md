**UnityAyoExtensions** is a collection of Unity editor extensions developed by Ayo to enhance the workflow of Unity developers. This package will continue to grow with new tools that provide convenient editor enhancements and improved workflow support.

## Tool: Blender Scene View Control

**Blender Scene View Control** is the first tool in the UnityAyoExtensions package, offering Blender-like scene view control functionality within the Unity Editor. This tool uses Unity's built-in `[Shortcut]` attribute to set up hotkeys for scene view manipulation, allowing developers to quickly switch between different perspectives. This can significantly boost productivity, especially when frequently adjusting scene views to check object alignment and environment setup.

### Features

- **Quick View Switching**: Quickly switch to front view, right view, top view, bottom view, etc., using the Numpad keys.
- **View Rotation**: Supports quick view rotation using hotkeys to easily inspect the scene from different angles.
- **Toggle Orthographic and Perspective View**: Switch between orthographic and perspective views with a single hotkey.
- **Reset View**: Supports resetting the scene view to a default angle, allowing quick return to common perspectives.

### Default Hotkey Configuration

The default hotkeys are configured as follows:

- **Front View**: `Numpad 1`
- **Right View**: `Numpad 3`
- **Top View**: `Numpad 7`
- **Bottom View**: `Numpad 9`
- **Rotate Down**: `Numpad 2`
- **Rotate Up**: `Numpad 8`
- **Rotate Left**: `Numpad 4`
- **Rotate Right**: `Numpad 6`
- **Toggle Orthographic Mode**: `Numpad 5`
- **Reset View**: `Numpad 0`

### How to Use

1. After installing UnityAyoExtensions, these hotkeys will be automatically added to your Unity Editor.
2. Use the hotkeys listed above to quickly switch views or adjust the scene view in the Scene window.

### Future Plans

This is just the first tool in the UnityAyoExtensions package. We plan to add more practical editor enhancement tools in the future, covering everything from scene management to asset optimization. Stay tuned for future updates!
